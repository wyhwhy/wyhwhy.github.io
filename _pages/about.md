Hi, my name is Yuhao Wang. I am a second-year PhD candidate at [School of Data Science](https://www.sdsc.cityu.edu.hk/) at City University of Hong Kong, China. It's my honor to be supervised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) and work with fellows in [Applied Machine Learning Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/).

Research
======

I have a broad interest in data science and artificial intelligence. 
My current research mainly focuses on **Recommender System**, especially multi-scenario modeling. 

Award
