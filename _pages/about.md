Hi, my name is Yuhao Wang. I will be a PhD candidate at [School of Data Science](https://www.sdsc.cityu.edu.hk/) at City University of Hong Kong, China. It's my honor to be supervised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) and work with fellows in [Applied Machine Learning Lab](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/aml.html).

Research
======

I have a broad interest in data science and artificial intelligence. 
My current research mainly focuses on **Recommender System** and **Reinforcement Learning**.
